If you are a lady 18+ years of age, we welcome you to join us for a meet-n-greet hack night!

We can get you started on the path to programming, or help you out with that annoying bug.

Join us for next Thursday's hack night at West 6th Brewing. For directions see this [Google Map](https://goo.gl/maps/ebJs6).
