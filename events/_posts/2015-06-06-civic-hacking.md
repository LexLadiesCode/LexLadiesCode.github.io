On June 6, 2015, thousands of people from across the United States will come together for National Day of Civic Hacking. The goal of National Day of Civic Hacking is for residents, community groups, and government to collaborate to make their communities stronger. Lexingtonians will gather at the CirrusMio offices to explore open data, work on existing project, and maybe start some new projects. Join some of the LexLadies and help out!
