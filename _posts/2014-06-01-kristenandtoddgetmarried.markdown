The Ladies designed a wedding website for our member Kristen. The site gave guests all the details they needed to make the weekend as effortless and memorable as possible. We told the couple's story through a comic strip created by Kristen and Rebecca. The site gave information on the registry, location, and Lexington landmarks for folks from out of town. Sarah created a webscraper to get the latest data from the registry to view the funding progress of each gift.
