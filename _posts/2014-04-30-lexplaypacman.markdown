Lex Play Pac-Man was an idea that formed in the mind of Lexington Public Library Adult Services Librarian Eli Riviere Warner, and chased her like Blinky until she allowed it to consume her. The tournament is a part of [Lexington Public Library's](http://www.lexpublib.org/) annual [One Book One Bluegrass](http://www.onebookonebluegrass.com/) celebration - a community reading project celebrated concurrently with several other surrounding library systems across the Bluegrass.
