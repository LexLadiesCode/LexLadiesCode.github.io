LexPlayPacman was our first project, designed for the
[Lexington Public Library](http://www.lexpublib.org/). LexPlayPacman is a Ruby on Rails
web application that acts as a score leaderboard for a Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man tournament. Games
were played on arcade machines around Lexington. 

The tournament spanned the month of April 2014, and 80 scores were recorded. Both the library and the project received a lot of great publicity. Congratulations, Eli Reveire Warner, on the success of our first project!
