Vanessa came to Lexington for her MA in geography, which she earned in 2013. Recently, she  became mommy to a sweet baby boy. LexLadiesCode is her first leisure pursuit since becoming a mommy. She is excited to update her very limited and very old programming knowledge with the support of a talented group of ladies.
