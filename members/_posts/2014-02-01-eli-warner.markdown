Eli Riveire graduated from the University of Kentucky with a BA in Telecommunications and a Masters degree in Library Science. After a brief stint creating the physical and digital archives at Buffalo Trace Distillery, she became an Adult Services Librarian at the Central branch of the [Lexington Public Library](http://www.lexpublib.org) in 2012, where her role consists of adult programming, email reference, digital snooping, and more obituaries than at which one could comfortably shake a stick. She became Eli Riveire Warner in 2013 when she married [this dude](http://nwarner.com), and is still a total n00b at programming (but is having fun learning!).
