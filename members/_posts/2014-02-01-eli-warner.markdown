Eli launched into the exciting world of libraries and archives after finishing her MLS at the University of Kentucky in 2011. After a brief stint creating the physical and digital archives at Buffalo Trace Distillery, she started as an Adult Services Librarian at the Central branch of the [Lexington Public Library](http://www.lexpublib.org) in 2012. She became Eli Riveire Warner in 2013 when she married [this dude](http://nwarner.com), and is still a total n00b at programming (but is having fun learning!).
