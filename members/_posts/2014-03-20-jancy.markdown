Jancy graduated from [Transylvania University](http://www.transy.edu/) with BA in Computer Science and minor in German.  Currently, she works at [Perceptive Software from Lexmark](http://www.perceptivesoftware.com/) as a Project Manager.  She got involved with LexLadiesCode because she wants to dust off her computer science degree and get back into development.
