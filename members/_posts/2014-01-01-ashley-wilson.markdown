Ashley is a user-centered designer and developer. She gets pumped about HCI research and human learning. Last year she lived in Portugal where she completed a dual-masters in Human-Computer Interaction.

In her free time she enjoys creating educational games, hacking with others, and cooking. Some day she hopes to combine all these activities into one!
