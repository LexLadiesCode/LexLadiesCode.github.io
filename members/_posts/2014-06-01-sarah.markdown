Sarah graduated from the [University of Kentucky](http://www.uky.edu/) with her B.S. in 2009 and her M.S. in 2011, both in computer science. She currently works at [CirrusMio](http://www.cirrusmio.com/) as a Ruby on Rails developer. She got involved with LexLadiesCode because she enjoys sharing knowledge with
others, and is excited to get other women involved in programming and web
design.
