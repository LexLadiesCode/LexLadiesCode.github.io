## How To Contribute

### Jekyll

This site uses Jekyll to create static HTML pages. You'll need the Jekyll gem to generate pages. Read more about how to install and use it here: http://jekyllrb.com/

### GitHub Pages

The site is hosted on GitHub via the awesome GitHub Pages feature. You push your changes and GitHub rebuilds the pages using Jekyll. Read more about how it works here: https://pages.github.com/

### Bootstrap

The site uses Twitter Bootstrap for style. Try it out for yourself! http://getbootstrap.com/

### Markdown

Pages in a Jekyll site can be created using basic HTML, Markdown, or Textile. We'll use Markdown heavily. Markdown is a way to turn simple text into HTML. Everything you'd want to know is here: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

### Liquid

We'll insert some programming logic into our website using Liquid. More about that soon! Check out index.html for a look. http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-basics
